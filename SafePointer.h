 *
 *	A class representing a safe pointer.
 *	The members forth and back are representing the number
 *	of memory blocks that are allowed to be accessed.
 *	example:
 *
 *	blocks of array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
 *	                 ^     ^
 *	                 |     |
 *	                 |     |
 *	             m_first m_pointer
 *	      m_forth=3 There are 3 blocks ahead
 *	      m_back=3  There are 3 blocks to the back
 * If the user is trying to advance more than m_forth an exception
 * is raised. Same for m_back. out_of_range
 *
 * If the user uses the following operators: (pointer - pointer), >, <, >=, <= on pointers that don't
 * have the same m_first, an exception is raised - range_error.
 *
 * operator+ is implemented using a templated friend function to prevent implicit conversion
 * of parameter int. Keep in mind that by using this approach operator+<int> is not friend
 * with SafePointer<char>. This approach is preferable over defining a new template inside the
 * class for the function as it allows operator+<int> to be a friend to SafePointer<char>.
 *
 * For the (pointer - pointer) == > < >= <= I used the Barton-Nackman trick in order
 * to allow implicit conversion from SafeArray to SafePointer.
